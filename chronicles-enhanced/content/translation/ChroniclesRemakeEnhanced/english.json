    "campaign.hc1_main.glory b.h3m.prolog": "Upon defeating Rabak, Tarnum named himself King of the Barbarians - a title not held by one of his people since Bracaduun conquered their lands.  But in the eyes of the Wizard-Kings, he was just a rebel fly to be squashed.",
    "campaign.hc1_main.glory c.h3m.prolog": "The bards possessed the history and identity of the Barbarian people, but after generations of oppression only four still lived.  Knowing the importance of these wise men, the Wizard, Kurl, imprisoned them in his Tower and held them for ransom - Tarnum's life in exchange for the bards.",
    "campaign.hc1_main.glory d.h3m.prolog": "Although the Wizard-Kings ruled the Mudlands, not even they were able to completely control these muggy swamps.  Then Tarnum dragged his armies through the mud with just one goal in mind - join the forces of the Mudlands with his own, so he could finally bring down the Empire of Bracaduun.",
    "campaign.hc1_main.glory e.h3m.prolog": "A vast mountain range called the Wallpeaks separated the Barbarian Steppes from the Empire of Bracaduun, so the Wizards built a Castle in every pass to keep their lands safe from invasion.

    "campaign.hc1_main.glory f.h3m.prolog": "Tarnum and his Horde broke through the Wallpeaks, but he found the Wizards prepared for his arrival.  A trap!  Hundreds of his troops were buried in a magical avalanche, leaving him weak and surrounded in the land of his enemy.",
    "campaign.hc1_main.glory g.h3m.prolog": "Years of oppression, the loss of everyone he loved, and an unexpected betrayal brought Tarnum to this dark point where his rage conquered reason.  He decided the only way he and his people would ever be safe was to execute every living spellcaster in the world, and anyone who didn't join him was his enemy.",
    "campaign.hc1_main.glory h.h3m.epilog": "With the defeat of Castle Steelhorn, Tarnum shattered the power of the Wizard-Kings, but his tyrannical rule was short.  Out of the ruins of the Empire of Bracaduun climbed the upstart nation of Erathia, and one day its king would defeat Tarnum, sending him before the Ancestors to be judged.  But that is another story.",

But the fire didn't burn.  This is where the Immortal Hero discovered a secret that would later give him an advantage over the Elemental Lords.",
    "campaign.hc3_main.Elemental F.h3m.prolog": "Tarnum discovered that the force used to bind the elements together was magic, so he became one of the first to travel to the Plane of Magic where anything was possible.  And soon he was in a race against the minions of the Elemental Lords to gain the help of the mysterious Magic Elementals.  ",
    "campaign.hc3_main.Elemental G.h3m.prolog": "Tarnum always had an obsessive hatred for slavers, so when he learned the Fire Lord had enslaved the beautiful Phoenix he nearly dropped everything.

Slowly, a new life spread through Vorr.  His wounds healed, and he stood.  Tears streamed from Vorr's eyes as he embraced Tarnum.  Not only had the World Tree cured his wounds, but the insane hatred that had tainted him.

Take the letters to Queen Allison and all the flowery speech.

I felt the rage hot beneath my skin like a fire that couldn't be put out no matter how much blood I spilled, no matter how many villages I razed.\n\nThen I'm standing alone, here in the Underworld amid a field of bones, and I can hear the silent screams of every skull.  Screams for help.  Screams of the innocent I killed.\n\nI clap my hands over my ears and shout, \"I was wrong!  I was wrong!

She's saved!\n\nHe slays one of the Ogres with his first swing, then turns his horse to dodge the attack of the other.  He dispatches this enemy just as easily.

My horse had been cut from underneath me and I was fighting hand-to-hand with Golems, Gargoyles and Wizards.  I saw a pack of Gremlins swarm Hardac, yet he stood his ground even with a wound in the side.  He knew he was dead, but refused to retreat.\n\nSo, I hacked my way through to save his life.  I carried Hardac back to our healers and returned to the fighting.  Somehow, we pulled off a victory that day, but at a great loss.

But Hardac was the only one courageous enough to tell me I was wrong.\n\n\"Attack this enemy like that,\" he said, \"and we'll leave most of our army dead on the battlefield - that is, if we win.  Lure the Nagas out, draw them away from the Mages, and then attack.\"\n\nI swallowed my pride and took Hardac's advice, and it's a good thing because the very next day we were ambushed and we only survived because we didn't take many losses against the Nagas.  That's when I knew to always keep Hardac close.",

So, when the bards were captured I knew it was over if they were killed.\n\nYes, I raised a force and broke the wall of Kurl's Tower.  We dominated his army - the courtyard was red with the blood of the Mages.  I reached Kurl's private chambers only to find him cowering there, begging for his life.  And here's where the dream veered from the memory.  Instead of letting him go, I showed him no mercy.  I slaughtered him on the spot because hanging from the trees in Kurl's private garden were four figures swaying in the wind.  The bards - dead.\n\nOur history was lost - forever changed.  And I was to blame.  I woke up weeping and confused.  It was only a dream, wasn't it?  I remember saving three of the bards.  Our history was still safe.",

I noticed it the first time we met, something about her mannerisms, or maybe the way she talks?  Or could it be her fiery red hair?  Sure, it's a popular color among Barbarians, but there's no way we could've met - I died before she was born.",

And why do they seem more real with each passing day?\n\nIt's hard sometimes to determine the difference between the waking world and this horrid Underworld.

A group of Magogs have been taunting us with their hit-and-run ambushes, so I led a small force to hunt them down.  Well, I led the men straight into an ambush.  We were outnumbered and trapped in a cave for several days.  It was my error, and it cost several men their lives.\n\nHow do you do it?  How do you deal with the death of the soldiers under your command?\n\nQueen Allison.\"",
    "map.hc2_main:3.event.13.description": "I have learned through my contacts that Allison was grossly unprepared when she went Magog hunting, so I sit to compose a response.\n\n\"Dear Queen Allison,\n\nIf you want to kill yourself, put a blade in your heart - it's easier.  A leader doesn't go running off into the dark corners of the Underworld simply to prove how brave she is.  What were you thinking taking such a small escort?\n\nIf you insist on acting like a child, I shall treat you like one.  Do something like that again, and I will toss you over my knee and tan your hide.  You have lost the lives of many good men, and nearly lost the life of the Queen of Erathia.  Living with the losses of your soldiers is made easier when you know that you have done everything within your power to keep them alive, no matter the odds!\n\nSir Tarnum\"\n",

That morning, I announced our war was over - we were returning home.  The men cheered, and Hardac and the other captains seemed genuinely surprised.\n\nThen we had a victory feast before we started our journey home, and at the beginning of the feast I shared my cup of ale with each of my captains.  When the cup came back to me, I pretended to spill its contents.  But by then the poison was already taking effect.  I won't go into the horrible details, but they all died before my eyes, choking and cursing my name with their last breath.\n\nThe next morning, I told my army that the Wizards had poisoned the captains - the war began again.",

I've received several letters from Knights claiming she is ready to be knighted, but that she won't let anyone but me give her such an honor.\n\nIt's time.  I quickly compose a letter asking Allison to pass command to her most trusted captain and join me as soon as she can.\n\nHer confidence in me has only made me realize that I have sat idle too long about this matter with Mensor.

I nodded and dismissed the other Captains, knowing that this was the confrontation I had been dreading.\n\n\"Maybe I should call you King Tarnum, the Tyrant?\" Mensor said.  No reason denying it now.\n\n\"Yes, I was once the Barbarian King.  I didn't set out to be a tyrant though.  Before I knew it, I had become exactly what I set out to battle.  Things happened that I...\"\n\n\"Don't give me pathetic excuses!  How is it you're alive, walking around, and no older than when you supposedly died, if my figures are right?  What are you, a Lich?  Some kind of unnatural?  What kind of beast are you?\"\n\n\"A man, like you,\" I said.\n\n\"Not like me!  You're a murderer!\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" I hushed him.  He had shouted that last part loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\n\"Tell a single soul and you'll kill us all,\" I warned him. \"My actions speak for themselves.  I've gotten us this far, but now is not the time for everything to fall apart.  You know as well as I that we are committed to this quest.  No turning back now.  I am here because I want to help Queen Allison.\n\nIf you don't want to hear my story, fine.  But if you try to expose my secret, you'll learn what a tyrant I can truly be.  I won't let these men die because of one man who enjoys poking his nose where it doesn't belong!\"",
    "map.hc2_main:5.event.21.description": "I gave Mensor and myself a couple days to cool off, then I summoned him to my tent.  When he entered, he stared at me, open hatred in his eyes.  I'd seen worse, but I also knew by his cautious stance that he was plotting my assassination.\n\n\"Mensor, maybe you'll never believe that I truly am on your side.  I'm here to help Queen Allison - that's all.  When I'm done, you'll never see me again.  But until you believe me, I've decided that I have to play your game for the sake of all these men\"\n\nA look of uncertainty flickered across his face.\n\n\"I have a piece of information that would not only bring down Queen Allison, but the Kingdom of Erathia as well.  Knowing how much you care for your people, you'll not want to risk this secret getting out.  Especially if, say, I were to mysteriously die, and then a loyal soldier with orders to take a certain letter to the upper world and give it to the first minstrel he finds.  Minstrels are notoriously bad at keeping secrets, you know.\"\n\n\"What secret?\" Mensor asked hesitantly.  This was the game he was used to playing, and he could tell that I was not bluffing. ",
    "map.hc2_main:5.event.22.description": "Mensor has been cold toward me for some time now, but as least no one has attempted to put a dagger in my back.  He's returned to his work with a vengeance, but now he only sends his reports in written form.\n\nWhen we first started working together I got the impression he liked me, and I certainly liked him.

By the time I reached the commotion, I saw Mensor fighting a losing battle with one of the enemy.  He's a better spy than swordsman.

The rest of the ambushers were dead in minutes.\n\nWhen the combat was over, I met Mensor's gaze but he said nothing.  His wounds were still minor, but I sent him to the healer to have them treated.",
    "map.hc2_main:5.event.24.description": "\"Tarnum, why did you save me?\"  Mensor's question was direct, asked the instant he stepped into my tent. \n\n\"Because you were in trouble.  It's what friends do for each other,\" I said matter-of-factly.  I wasn't in the mood to deal with this man's anger, so I turned my attention back to sharpening my sword.\n\n\"Your secret could've been safe with me dead?\"\n\n\"Uh, huh.\"\n\nMensor shook his head and left.",
    "map.hc2_main:5.event.25.description": "Finally, last night Mensor showed up at my tent with a tankard of ale and two mugs.  He filled them to the brim and sat.\n\nI looked at the amber liquid in my cup and smiled, \"Wouldn't be poisoned, would it?\"\n\nAnd I drank it down before Mensor could reply, showing him that I trusted him despite our disagreement.\n\n\"I'm ready to hear your story, Tarnum,\" Mensor said softly.  He took a large gulp too.\n\n\"Fine.  I'll tell you everything, but I want you to know right now that I'm making no excuses.  I did the crimes you hate me for.  Just like I'm no longer the Barbarian Tyrant, nor was I the tyrant in the beginning.  In fact, I was a simple herder barely surviving in a harsh land...\"",
    "map.hc2_main:5.event.26.description": "It's been a few days since I told Mensor about my long life.  Quiet days.\n\nThen he rode up next to me this morning and said, \"I've heard stories about your death.  King Gryphonheart's wife, your sister, wept for days, and when she couldn't be consoled Gryphonheart returned to the battlefield to recover your body.  Of course, he didn't find it, but he assumed some of your own kind carried it away to some secret place.  The Queen honored you, even though you were our enemy.\"\n\nTears were already flowing down my cheeks.\n\n\"I thought you would like to know that she forgave you,\" Mensor said.  \"I can't forgive the Barbarian King - many of my bloodline were killed by your armies.\"\n\nSo, that's why he hated me so much.  I'm responsible for the deaths of several of his family members.\n\n\"But I can forgive you,\" Mensor continued with some effort.  \"You're a different person now - I can see that.\"\n\nMensor extended his hand in friendship and I accepted it gladly.",

I wonder what would happen if everyone found out that Queen Allison is the niece of Tarnum the Barbarian Tyrant?  Mayhem, I would think.  Certainly, Allison would lose her head.  Everything I have said can be confirmed, you know I'm not lying.\"\n\nMensor left the tent, stunned and confused.

But these caverns are too vast for me to find the Pendant by myself.\n\nSo, I confided in Mensor, certain that the man will keep this information confidential.  When you need a devious plan, leave it up to a good spy.  Since we'll be searching for something anyway, Mensor is going to let it slip to the soldiers that we're looking for an artifact of great power that will help us locate Rion Gryphonheart's soul.  To support this rumor, I am to order the men to report the discovery of ANY magical item they find, and that rewards will be given to those who do.\n\nAn excellent plan, and it's not even a lie - not entirely.",

Is she all right?\"\n\n\"She led us to victory, Sir Tarnum!\"  That was a relief to hear.\n\n\"It was like fighting beside her father again,\" the messenger says proudly.  \"She held back the charge of the Champions even when they protested.  The Marksmen held their attacks as well, until the Minotaurs came within range.  Then the Queen released the full power of the Marksmen.   Many of the enemy died in that exchanged, so she used the Champions to harass them further, charging then fleeing.  By the time the Minotaurs reached our lines, there were too few to mount an effective offense.\"\n\nI smile proudly at my student's success and say, \"Return to the Queen and tell her that I am very impressed.

They will do whatever you want them to do whenever you tell them to do it!\"\n\n\"Yeah, Prolific...\"\n\n\"PON-IFIC, lord.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but they don't do EVERYTHING you ask them to do.

Never have I seen so much pale flesh at one time.  But I have to admit, after nearly two months on the Plane of Earth, these scrawny men were beginning to show some signs of getting in shape.  Their white bellies were a little smaller and their stick-like limbs starting to show some muscle.\n\nI tore off my robe and walked among them.\n\n\"Who wants to wrestle?\" I said.  A few of the Mages even looked like they wanted to, but no one dared step forward.  They almost found their courage.\n\n\"Ha!  I'll make Barbarians out of you yet!\"",

It took me a moment to recall it, but when I did I bolted from my tent and immediately cast a spell of sparkling blue light into the air above camp.\n\nStrewn throughout the camp was a horde of Troglodytes attempting to sneak into all of the tents!  One stood just a few feet away from me, temporarily startled by the explosion of light.  I punched it hard enough to crack its skull.\n\n\"Up you lazy Wizards!\" I shouted.  \"The enemy is here!\"\n\nEven though the Troglodytes managed to get into the camp, we made short work of them with no losses and only a few injuries.\n",

However, I noticed Barsolar had lost some weight around the middle and his face seemed more defined.  The exercise that came with long weeks of exploration must agree with the man.\n\n\"So, do you have anything new to report?\" I asked once he had a drink of cool water.\n\n\"Not much,\" he said, then reached into his robe and pulled out a short length of wood, broken and splintered on one end.\n\n\"Just this,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The base of a Wizard's staff.  I even recognize the symbols there at the bottom - it belonged to a famous Wizard who disappeared almost two hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"What's it doing here then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, the story goes that a group of powerful Mages wanted to create the ultimate Golem, so they tried to find passage to the Plane of Earth, where they could possibly find the hardest substance in the universe.  Many believe they died when they cast the spell - appeared at the bottom of the ocean or something - but others think they made it to the Plane of Earth but couldn't find a way back.\"\n\n\"That sounds familiar,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes.  It doesn't matter, since this happened two hundred years ago - they'd all be dead by now,\" Barsolar said.\n\n\"Unfortunate.  We could've used the help.\"\n",
    "map.hc3_main:3.event.7.description": "We all assumed they would be dead, so when a group of rugged-looking Mages stepped from a large cave we never imagined they were the Mages who came to the Plane of Earth to make the ultimate Golems.

To our amazement, Reamus and the others claimed to have been in this place for only sixteen years.  Impossible, considering they have been missing for two hundred.  Someone was wrong.\n\n\"But you've been gone for…\" began Ponific, the Golem Master.\n\n\"So long!\" I interrupted.  If these men actually don't realize how long they've been away, blurting it out was not the way to tell them.  \"How did you survive?\"\n\nReamus explained that they constructed Golems as their soldiers - two guards for each Mage.  Whenever one of the Golems was destroyed, they just made another.  Unfortunately, they had not yet discovered a way to make the ultimate Golem.\n",

How can they believe that they've only been away for sixteen years?\" I demanded.  I had the sinking feeling that I wasn't going to like the answer.\n\nHemoross, the Mage Instructor, shook his head.  So did Ponific and the others.  Only Barsolar seemed to have an idea, if his serious expression was any indication.\n\n\"What is it, Barsolar?\" I asked.  He had been studying these Elemental Planes even as he explored them.\n\n\"It would take some experiments to test my theory, Lord Tarnum,\" Barsolar said noncommittally.\n\n\"I don't care about experiments, Barsolar!  I want answers - even if you're not sure.  What's going on here?\"\n\n\"Time, Lord Tarnum.  The Elemental Planes are fundamentally different from our world.  It would make sense that Time, too, would work differently here,\" Barsolar said.\n\nThe other Wizards all nodded as they began to follow their colleague's path of thought.\n\n\"So,\" I said, \"are you telling me that everything moves slower here than in our world?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Or you could say Time moves quicker in our world.  Either way, two hundred years in our world is equivalent to sixteen here.  We can expect that by the time we return to our world, at least a couple decades will have passed.\"\n\nSeveral of the advisors dropped their wine cups.

Or does he?  I still suspect that Barsolar, not Hemoross, was behind the potion in my tea that kept me seasick the entire time I was on the Plane of Water.\n\n\"Well, \" Barsolar began to explain, \"I have been wondering why the fire here does not burn us.  Even paper doesn't burn, unless...\"\n\nBarsolar pulled a sheet of parchment from his robes, curled it into a tube, and held it above the flames licking at his feet.  At first, nothing happened.  Then it caught fire so quickly Barsolar had to toss the paper away before it burned his fingers.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" I asked.\n\n\"The fire reacts to your thoughts.  If you want it to burn something, it will.  It's almost a living entity, similarly to the Elementals but not sentient,\" Barsolar said.\n\nI was impressed.

I found him capable, and not as annoying as my other assistants.  I can't put my finger on the reason I get along with him any better than the others, especially since his name has so many easy and vulgar ways to mess it up.\n\n\"The Elemental Lords have an unprecedented command over their respective elements.  Alone, one of them has power beyond imagination.  Together, I do not think we can beat them,\" Reamus said.\n\n\"There has to be a way,\" I said.  The Ancestors wouldn't have sent me to face them if it was impossible.\n\n\"What we need,\" I said, \"is something they don't have.  I can stand toe-to-toe with them once I get control of all these Elementals, but what I need is a weapon they have no defense against.\"\n\n\"We'll work on it, Lord,\" said Reamus.",

I have long wondered that if water, air, fire, and earth can be segregated such as this, then what keeps them together.  What binds them, for instance, in our world?\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"Magic,\" Barsolar said.  I let them know I was skeptical.  According to a Wizard, magic is the answer to every question.\n\n\"Yes,\" Reamus continued, \"I haven't been able to prove it until I spoke with Barsolar about his experiments with the fire.  We know the fire isn't alive, yet it hears our thoughts and reacts to them.  Perhaps that is how the Elemental Lords manipulate their world so easily - they are linked with the element itself.  We think that magic, and perhaps even thought, are elements just like fire and water.  If this is true, then there might be a Plane of Magic.\"\n\n\"And Magic Elementals!\" Barsolar added.\n\nMagic Elementals.

A moment later, where there had been nothing before, a tall figure in a black robe and red turban stood before us.  As I approached, I immediately noticed the creature had no face - just a swirling mass of sparkling lights.  It remained still.  If it had legs, it made no effort to step down from the portal Barsolar and Reamus had created.\n\n\"Greetings,\" I said, \"we're…\"\n\nI KNOW.

Before I could form my next question, I heard them again.\n\nI AM A PSYCHIC ELEMENTAL.  YES, I COME FROM THE PLANE OF MAGIC.  VERY WELL, I WILL STOP ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU ASK THEM AND LET YOU SPEAK.\n\nMy knees grew weak, as if I had been running all day.

Besides, it moved too smoothly to be walking.\n\n\"What?\" I said.\n\nBut then it dawned on me, a creature that reads the thoughts of everyone around it would already know if someone were lying to them.

All knew this was going to be an important meeting.  I wasn't a fool.  I knew now that my decision to return to the Plane of Fire and save the Phoenixes had divided my forces.  Some, such as the Gremlins and Genies, sided with me, but the Mages wanted to stay here in the Plane of Magic.\n\nThe word spread quickly through camp, and soon my advisors poured from their tents and sat down at the table.  I noticed that Hemoross wouldn't meet my gaze.  Reamus looked concerned.\n\n\"Everyone knows I want to return to the Plane of Fire.  My decision has caused some problems here in camp.  I want to know if your resistance to save the Phoenixes is a selfish desire to study this Plane of Magic, or some other motivation,\" I said.\n\nThe others looked at their hands, the table, anything but my stern face.  Only Reamus was brave enough to speak.\n\n\"It's a matter of urgency, Lord Tarnum.  We know we need the help of the Magic Elementals to defeat the Elemental Lords.  The Magic Elementals will be available to us for a limited time.  However, the Phoenixes will still be the prisoners of the Fire Lord,\" Reamus said.  I couldn't argue with his logic, which only upset me more.  Since when did I start letting logic rule my decisions?\n\n\"So, Reamus, you want to let the Phoenixes suffer more while we hunt for the Magic Elementals, is that right?\"\n\n\"To save the world, yes!\" Reamus said.\n\nI found myself agreeing with the man despite myself, but I was still too angry to leave without striking a few blows of my own.\n\n\"Very well, we'll let the Phoenixes suffer their enslavement for a while longer,\" I said.  \"How easily Wizards accept enslavement.

That's when everyone becomes deathly quiet as if I was the one they had been talking about.  I'm convinced something is going on.  And I'm afraid this is the sort of conspiracy that usually ends in death.\n\nLast night, after dinner, I returned to my tent because no one seemed in the mood to talk.  I wasn't about to sit around and do nothing about the secrets flying through my camp, but I couldn't strong-arm the men into talking.  These Wizards already disliked my tactics.\n\nSo, I resorted to magic.  I've had control over Air Magic for some time now, so it was easy for me make the air around the camp thinner.  Then I grabbed the vibrations of even the softest sound and directed them toward my own ear.  Suddenly, I was able to hear the conversations of every person in camp as if they were standing right next to me.\n\nFirst, I found Reamus mumbling to himself about elemental magic.  He was alone, so I searched out another familiar voice.  I smiled.  Sometimes, magic had its uses.\n\n\"I'm not so sure that's wise,\" said Ponific hesitantly.  \"I mean, he's managed to get us this far, hasn't he?\"\n\n\"Fool!  He doesn't care about a single one of us.  He's leading us all to our deaths, I tell you.  Listen to his own words - he despises Wizards!  He's a Barbarian, I say!\"\n\nI was certain this last voice belonged to Hemoross, the Mage Instructor.\n\n\"Don't be silly!  He's the best Wizard I've seen, maybe even as good as Gavin Magnus.  No Barbarian spy could do that!\"\n\n\"Look at him!  He's as much said so himself - he hates Wizards!  You'll see, and you'll be sorry!\"\n\nMost of the other whispered conversations in camp were about me.  Nearly everyone suspected that I was a Barbarian spy determined to bring about the downfall of King Magnus.  Some even claimed I got us lost on the Elemental Planes on purpose.\n\nI ended my spell and took a drink of wine.  I hadn't realized it had gotten this bad.",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.13.description": "This morning, Hemoross made his move.  Before we had a chance to have a bite to eat, he stood up and demanded everyone's attention.\n\n\"I believe we should have a change in command,\" he said, \"and I think we will all agree that Reamus is the likely choice since Barsolar is not present.\"\n\nI immediately looked at Reamus, who had nearly choked on his tea.  At least Reamus wasn't in on this.  So, Hemoross was the instigator, but how much support did he have?  I had to know.\n\nComing to my feet, I said, \"You do realize, Hemoross, this is not a democracy.  I'm not going to take a vote!\"\n\n\"We don't want you as our leader anymore!  We want someone who is going to get us home safely.  If need be, we can remove you of your command.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?  Who exactly is going to do that?\"\n\nHemoross looked around at the faces of the Wizards gathered here.  Several were prepared to help him, but the others seemed uncertain.\n\n\"So, Hemoross, what are you going to do if I refuse to step down?  How far are you willing to go?\"\n\nI had to know, but a familiar sharp voice said, \"Hold on!\"\n\nIt was Barsolar, returning from the wild as I had asked.  I just hoped it wasn't a mistake.  Barsolar and I had never been on good terms, but at least it seemed we shared the same goal.  He would have to realize that Hemoross's actions would hurt our chances of defeating the Elemental Lords.\n\n\"Sit down, Hemoross, and stop this foolishness,\" Barsolar ordered.  He assumed the role of the King's cousin even though he was dressed in dirty, plain robes.\n\n\"None of us would still be alive if not for the leadership of this man, of Lord Tarnum!  I happen to know that King Magnus wanted Tarnum to lead this quest because Tarnum is skilled both in the tactics of war and magic.  He's our best chance at defeating the Elemental Lords!\"\n\nI was surprised by Barsolar's passionate defense.  He pretended that it had been the idea of Gavin Magnus to make me leader all along, and that they should trust their king's wisdom.\n\n\"And King Magnus will certainly learn about the pitiful way some of you have behaved,\" Barsolar said, staring directly at Hemoross.  Finally, the Mage Instructor sat down.\n",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.14.description": "Perhaps I am partially to blame for what happened this morning.  I treated Hemoross and the others poorly when I first became their commander.  Apparently, he never forgave me.  Nor did he forgive Barsolar for supporting me when Hemoross tried to take over.\n\nThat's why Hemoross attacked Barsolar.  The Mage Instructor called Barsolar from his tent and challenged him to a Wizard's duel.  I heard this and stormed out just in time to see Hemoross throw a crackling Lightning Bolt at Barsolar, who stood his ground.  The bolt never hit him, but deflected off an invisible shield and struck the ground instead.\n\n\"I've learned a few things while exploring the Plane of Magic,\" Barsolar said.\n\nThat's when I noticed a few of Hemoross's students sneaking around behind Barsolar.  They raised their hands to cast a spell, so I jumped into the duel.  Back to back, Barsolar and I faced the traitors.  I cast Frost Ring, followed immediately by a Fireball.  The Mages never had a chance.\n\nBehind me, Barsolar and Hemoross exchanged lightning bolts.  Hemoross must've realized he was no match for either of us, so he began to retreat.  I cast Slow on the man so he couldn't get away.  And then it was over.\n\n\"I yield!\" Hemoross shouted.\n\nBarsolar collapsed onto one knee, clutching a shoulder that still smoked from where he was struck by one of Lightning Bolts.\n\n\"Healer!\" I called, and then approached the Mage Instructor.\n\nTo Hemoross, I said, \"Not too bad for a Barbarian, eh?\"",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.15.description": "Soon, I am told, we will find the Magic Elementals and we will be able to return to the Plane of Fire to free the Phoenixes.  But I wonder if my army will be able to hold together for that long.  What about afterward?  I suspect many of the Mages hate me because I keep Hemoross locked up in a cage with Iron Golems as guards.\n\nHemoross caused a lot of damage before he tried to kill Barsolar.  His words planted seeds of doubt in the minds of my men.  That could prove fatal for us all.",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.2.description": "I was having breakfast, trying to ignore the Pixies as they flitted through the air over the camp, giggling and shrieking as they played some childish game.  One of them dropped low to avoid being tagged by one of the others and the Pixie's foot knocked over my bowl of oatmeal.  My angry shout put an end to the game.  I stood, scraping heavy globs of my morning meal from my robe.\n\n\"Blasted Pixies!\" I yelled.  \"Find somewhere else to play, or by the Ancestors, I'm going to blow off your wings with a lightning bolt!\"\n\nThe Pixies fled as I strolled back to my tent to change my clothes.",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.3.description": "For some reason, Hemoross followed me into my tent.  The moment I saw his gloating smile, I wanted to slap him.\n\n\"What is it?\" I barked.\n\n\"My, you have changed since you first took command,\" Hemoross said.  \"Your beard is neatly trimmed, and I heard you took a bath this morning.  Now, you're fussing over a dirty robe!\"\n\nI stared at myself, realizing to my shame that Hemoross was right.  I had become one of them.  I was a Wizard!  If not for my size, a stranger would never suspect that I used to be a Barbarian.  I tore off the stained robe and threw it at the Mage Instructor.\n\n\"Do something useful and have that cleaned!\" I snapped.\n\nHemoross laughed as he exited the tent; too pleased with his own victory to be insulted.\n",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.4.description": "A few days ago, Barsolar departed to study and explore this odd realm.  I doubt I could've forced him to stay even if I chained him to one of the Golems.  Well, he's proven useful in the past, so I've asked him to keep an eye on the armies of the Elemental Lords for me.",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.5.description": "Barsolar's owl arrived this morning.  I guess even a Barbarian can get used to magical things such as talking owls if he's been exposed to it long enough.  As the owl began its report, I leaned back and listened as if I were talking to a normal messenger.\n\n\"Luck is with us, Lord Tarnum,\" the owl said in Barsolar's nasal voice.  \"These Elementals hate each other almost as much as they hate us.  They fight with each other.  They think that if one of them reaches the Magic Elementals first, they will be able to destroy the other elements as well as our own world.\"\n\nI hadn't expected good news this morning.  My enemy would be easier to deal with as long as they weren't unified. \n",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.6.description": "Today, I found a small well by the side of the road.  Deciding I could use all the luck I could get, I approached and dropped a coin inside.  A second later, I was hit in the head by something.  I rubbed the sore spot on the top of my skull, bent down to pick up the object that hit me and discovered it was the coin I just dropped into the well.  I glanced up at the sky just in time se see a dark cloud of something descending upon me.  I jumped out of the way as hundreds of Gold fell on the ground in the spot I had been standing.\n\nAmazed by this phenomenon, many of the other Wizards tried throwing their own coins inside the well, but nothing happened.  \n",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.7.description": "Reamus brought me a report this morning from the troops we left in the Plane of Fire to control the territory we conquered.  They have learned that the Lord of Fire has enslaved the great Phoenixes and forces them to fight for him, or else he'll destroy the places where the Phoenixes have been born since the beginning of time.\n\nAs I read this report, I clenched my fist around my staff.  The Elemental Lords were no different than the Wizards who once enslaved my people.  To make matters worse, I sat here looking and acting exactly like the bottom-feeders who nearly destroyed my people!\n",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.8.description": "I called a meeting of my top advisors this morning.  The Gremlins brought a table out into the middle of camp.  Usually, these meetings were held in private.  Much of what a Wizard does is done in secrecy and I was determined to hold on to at least a small portion of my real identity.  I could tell the Wizards were uncomfortable as a crowd of Gremlins and Mages gathered.\n\n\"We have a more urgent matter to deal with,\" I said sternly.  \"We must abandon our search for the Magic Elementals!\"\n\n\"But why?\" Hemoross said.\n\n\"Because I say so!  Because the Phoenixes are trapped on the Plane of Fire, slaves to the Fire Lord.  As long as I live, I will not allow any creature to be slave to another!\"\n\nThe Mages muttered to each other while some of my advisors protested all at once.\n\nCalmly, Reamus stood and said, \"Lord Tarnum, if we pull back from the Plane of Magic now, the Magic Elementals will be forced to join one of the Elemental Lords.  Then we'll be at a disadvantage.\"\n\nI glared at Reamus and the others.  Of course, they didn't care about the enslaved Phoenixes.  They are the descendents of the same Wizards who enslaved the Barbarians.\n\n\"I will not abandon the Phoenixes!\"\n\n\"I'm not asking that, Lord Tarnum, only that we finish what we do here first!\"\n\n\"No!  I am the commander here.  In a few days, I want to know how long it will take for use to return to the Plane of Fire!\" ",
    "map.hc3_main:5.event.9.description": "I heard the shouts soon after I retired to my tent for the night, and among the angry words I caught my name.  So, I slipped out the rear of my tent and raced among the shadows toward source of commotion - Reamus's tent.\n\n\"Filthy, thuggish lout!\" said Hemoross.\n\n\"Watch your voice!\" Reamus said.\n\n\"I don't care any longer!  He's a brute, not a real Wizard.  What was King Magnus thinking making him our leader?\"\n\n\"Magnus must've had his reasons.\"\n\n\"You weren't with us then, Reamus.  He's a thug.  Wouldn't even let us build a Mage Guild for the longest time, and I swear he was afraid of magic - like some stupid Barbarian.\"\n\n\"You're being foolish now, Hemoross.  He's as powerful as any Wizard I've met,\" Reamus said.  I could tell the man was attempting to calm Hemoross down.\n\n\"Just look at him!  He's no Wizard!  He's as big as any Barbarian, and I've even heard him pray to the Ancestors - those are the gods of the Barbarians, I've looked it up.  And now he wants to leave the Plane of Magic and save some silly Phoenixes.  This hypocrite!  Barbarians are the biggest slavers around!\"\n\nI had heard enough.  I could see Hemoross's shadow pacing on the other side of the tent cloth, so I punched my hand straight through and grabbed the man by his collar.  Hemoross squealed as I dragged him through the torn tent and through him on the ground.\n\nI wanted to smash his skull in, but I just stared at the man cowering at my feet.  I swallowed my anger and stormed off without another word.  I could tell by the expressions on everyone's faces that they all knew just how close Hemoross came to dying.\n",

Reamus suggested I leave the traitor behind, but I wanted him close so I could keep an eye on him.  Plus, Barsolar wants to bring Hemoross back before the justice of King Magnus.  Perhaps Barsolar thought Magnus would be more lenient.\n\n\"We both acted poorly,\" Barsolar admitted.  \"I'm thankful that you trusted me to search the Elemental Planes for you.  Few have trusted my abilities before, being related to the King may have its perks, but no one ever believes you earned your position with your own skills.\"\n\n\"Yes, well, I really just wanted to get you out of my hair,\" I said.\n\nBarsolar smiled at my honesty and said, \"My thanks for your confidence, Lord Tarnish!\"\n\nI laughed.  Now, that's how the game of insults is played!\n\n\"See you later, Boar's-Molar!\" I called as the Wizard left my tent.  I could hear the man's hearty laughter as he walked away.",

After countless years as a military leader, I've learned to cast my voice in such a way as to command attention.\n\n\"Reamus, what's is this?\" I said.\n\nThe Wizard waved his hand at a group of Fire Elementals and said, \"They're trying to defect from the Fire Lord's army, but the Water Elementals don't trust them.\"\n\n\"How can we?  They're Fire - they serve the stinking Fire Lord!  They're assassins!\" said a Water Elemental.\n\nI stared at the Fire Elementals, but it was impossible to determine anything from their fiery expressions.  They had been part of the enemy - it would be foolish to accept them into my own forces without being suspicious.\n\nBut before I could make my decision, Barsolar approached hurriedly.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Lord Tarnum,\" Barsolar said, \"But in my early report I was going to give you some good news.  Apparently, some of the Fire Elementals are leaving the Fire Lord's army because he's been gone for quite a while.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" shouted one of the Fire Elementals.  \"He's a cruel one, he is!\"\n\nI had an easier solution, and immediately summoned the leader of the Psychic Elementals.\n\n\"Tell me if these Fire Elementals truly want to join my forces, or do they have something else in mind?\" I asked the Psychic Elemental.\n\nTHEY ARE AFRAID THEIR MASTER WILL LOSE, SO THEY HOPE TO JOIN YOU, WHO THEY CALL \"MASTER OF ALL ELEMENTS\".\n\nWell, they were cowards, not deserters.

Was it worth this?\" I said, shaking the cage.\n\n\"Barbarians despise Wizards!  Why would one try to help us?\"\n\n\"As punishment, Hemoross,\" I said.\n\nHemoross really wasn't a bad person, just confused - as I had been.  The Ancestors gave me a second chance.  Perhaps I could give Hemoross one as well.\n\n\"I'm going to suggest to Magnus that you be given a promotion.  When this is all over, I'll use whatever power I have to have you named Peace Ambassador to the Barbarian lands,\" I said.\n\nAt first, Hemoross would consider such a promotion a punishment as well, but I could only hope that someday he would learn the same lessons I have learned here.",

Once this is over, they are going to remove that information from the minds of those who've learned it,\" I said firmly.\n\nThe power of the Elements was too great a temptation for the people of this world.

This man was immortal, and I wanted to know why.\n\n\"You're immortal,\" I said.\n\n\"Of course, but not in the same way as you,\" Magnus said.  \"I first found out I was immortal when one of your Behemoths killed me.

Since then, I have heard stories about you but nothing very substantial.  I knew some day our paths would cross again, especially when I became King of Bracada.  I used to hate you, Tarnum, the Barbarian King, but time has a way of making you forget.  Now, if you can manage to defeat these Elemental Lords, I will consider us even - perhaps even brothers,\" Magnus said with a wide smile.\n\nUnfortunately, I had no interest in being this man's friend.

    "map.hc4_main:3.event.4.description": "Aspen was sipping tea, minding his own business as I walked by.  I thought I was going to be able to avoid a conversation with the elderly spy, but I was wrong.\n\n\"I see you've developed an interest in our fair Captain Valita,\" Aspen said.\n\nI looked around to see if anyone was close enough to hear, but I shouldn't have bothered.  Aspen always had a way of talking when no one else could possibly hear.\n\n\"Have you finally realized that I am always right?\" Aspen asked with his usual cocky grin.\n\n\"No.  The only thing I've realized is I wish I had a wise advisor and not an arrogant one!\"\n\nAspen laughed despite the insult.\n\n\"It's not arrogance, my friend.  It's confidence!  You have the same confidence in your battle skills.  You have been victorious so many times that I'd wager the thought of losing doesn't even enter your head.  Well, I have been right so many times that I have stopped considering the possibility that I might be wrong.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes and immediately removed myself from my advisor's presence, but later I thought about Aspen's words.  There was a time when I did consider myself incapable of losing a battle.  In the end, I was wrong, but it took a sword in the gut to teach me that lesson.\n\nAnd even now, I realize that I hadn't considered the possibility that I might lose my fight against Mutare.  If she gains control of all the world's Dragons, how could I possibly win?",
    "map.hc4_main:3.event.5.description": "When we stopped at mid-day to water the horses, I took the opportunity to stretch my muscles and run around the camp.  To my surprise, as I ran past the supply wagons I saw Captain Valita talking to my Master of Supplies, Kurbon.  They seemed friendly toward each other, although Valita still took the short end of the conversation.\n\nI don't think I've ever heard a word come out of Kurbon's mouth that wasn't a complaint, so it was equally startling to see the Dwarf calm, even joking with the woman.",

I don't have the luxury of lounging about and doin' nothing all day.\"\n\n\"No, just a quick question.  I was wondering what you could tell me about Captain Valita.  Do you know her well?\"\n\nThe Dwarf's expression turned suspicious.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She's one of my captains, and she talks very little.  I'm curious.  I like to know the people I command,\" I said.\n\n\"You don't come around asking about me,\" Kurbon said.  He had me there.\n\n\"Besides,\" Kurbon continued, \"she's a good Ranger.  One of the best.  That's all you should care about!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  This hadn't gone as I expected, so I ended it.  One thing was for sure though.  Kurbon did know Valita, or I wouldn't have seen his protective side.\n\nSo, what was this loyalty he felt toward the Elven woman?",
    "map.hc4_main:3.event.7.description": "Aspen came to me soon after we set camp last night.  In his hand was a letter.\n\n\"A report from the Elf King.  I thought you would want to see it, although I could summarize it for you.  It's very interesting!\" Aspen said.\n\nI waited for the advisor to explain.\n\n\"The Elf King suffered a great loss recently.  Nearly three hundred Elves were killed in an ambush composed primarily of Dragons - Red, Black, and Rust.  The odd fact about the ambush is, these men - Sharpshooters - were experts at camouflage.  They know better than anyone how to stay hidden.  I wonder how the Dragon Queen knew where they would be?\"\n\n\"Just say it, Aspen.  I dislike word games,\" I said.\n\n\"It's further proof that a spy is feeding information to Nighon.  I'm certain of it!\" Aspen said.\n\n\"You may be right, but do you have any evidence about the identity of this traitor?\"\n\nAspen shook his head, dropped the letter into my hand.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he promised.  \"But I think we both have an idea, don't we?\"\n\nI refused to answer.",

I strolled back to the supply wagons where Kurbon and his workers were loading sacks of grain into the wagons and joined them for some much needed hard labor.  It felt good to exercise the muscles again.\n\nAfter an hour of work, sweat rolled down my bare back.  One of the workers handed me a small keg of ale so that I could take the first drink, but I handed it to Kurbon instead.\n\n\"He's the Master of Supplies here,\" I said, \"I'm just a worker like you.\"\n\nKurbon took a long gulp from the keg, then turned it over to me.  By the time everyone had a drink, our sweat had dried and we pulled on our shirts once again.\n\nBefore I left, I said, \"Feel free to invite me to join you the next time, Kurbon.

It reminds me of the days when I used to work from sunrise to dark.\"\n\n\"When did you do that?\" Kurbon said.\n\n\"Long time ago, before you were born.\"\n\n\"So, you are blessed with immortality, as they say?\"\n\n\"More like a curse,\" I said with a frown.\n\nKurbon wanted to know how I, a human, came to be so long-lived, but I couldn't bring myself to tell that story - not again.  The Dwarf waited a long time in silence before he realized I wasn't going to share my tale.\n\nKurbon took one last drink, and said, \"Hard work is good for the soul...\"\n\n\"...but ale is better,\" I said, completing the Dwarven proverb.",

Then Valita slowly lowered the bow.\n\n\"What are you doing here, sir?\" she said.\n\n\"I've come to collect one of my captains,\" I said.  \"She's been as big a fool as I have, and I hope to rectify both our mistakes.\"\n\n\"But I'm not the leader I used to be,\" Valita said.\n\n\"We'll talk about that,\" I said.  \"Fighting Mutare is what's important now - and I need every sword and bow I can get.\"\n\nValita hesitated there in the top of the tree, reluctant to step down and face whatever was bothering her.

I kept my mouth closed and watched, waited.\n\n\"Shame,\" she said.  \"That's what is always on my mind.\"\n\n\"Shame?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am a traitor!\"\n\nAnd tears fell on Valita's pale cheeks.  My stomach tensed, because I thought she was going to confess that she was Aspen's spy.  I realized that she was still armed, and my own sword was all the way on the other side of the tent.  Then Valita explained in a flood of bottled emotions.\n\n\"When the Devils had me in their dungeon, I betrayed everything and everyone I have ever loved!  Under those hot spikes and thrashing whips, I snapped.  I told them everything!  Men died!  MY men!\"\n\nI sat back in my chair, and I noticed that Valita was looking at me now, trying to determine my reaction to her confession.  She saw something in my eyes that surprised her.  Perhaps she had expected my hatred.\n\nInstead, I said, \"You were in prison for more than three months!  No one can expect to stand up to torture for that long - especially in the skilled hands of the Demons and Devils.\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"No!  I know something of shame, Valita.

There appeared to be no injuries, so I checked the hoof.\n\n\"Thinking about something, sir.\"\n\n\"Here's your problem,\" I said, pulling a sharp stone from the animal's hoof.\n\nThe horse tested the hoof and seemed prepared to continue the journey.

Like many of the Rangers, she kept a spoon tucked into one of her boots.\n\n\"Thank you, sir!\"\n\n\"Now, I told you to call me Tarnum,\" I insisted.  My voice was a little too firm.\n\n\"Tarnum.\"\n\nNow, it was time for me to be blunt.  No more games.\n\n\"You're too quiet for your own good, Captain Valita!\"\n\n\"Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"Yes!

Yours feel they don't know you, that you're aloof or arrogant as if you think you're better than them.\"\n\n\"What?  I've never said that!  I fight right beside them because I'm no more important than they are!\" Valita snapped.\n\n\"If all you do is fight beside them, then you might as well be a soldier, but you're an officer, Valita!  You must lead them!  What's worse, you haven't always been this way.  Some of the men who've fought with you in past can't be more loyal to you if they tried!  So, I must know what's wrong?\"\n\nBut Valita didn't have an answer.

What are you ashamed about?\"\n\nI had promised to tell her, but could I really explain where I came from and why I, a human, was immortal?\n\n\"To put it simply, I killed many, many people.  I believed I was right, and that anything I did in the name of my goal was right as well.\"\n\n\"Innocents died?\" she asked hesitantly.\n\n\"More than I care to think about,\" I said, \"including one of my own sisters.\"\n\n\"Your sister?  How do you live with yourself?\"\n\nI don't think Valita meant for her question to sound so harsh, but her words still bit deep into my soul.\n\n\"I have hope that some day I can make things right again,\" I said.\n\nValita sat in silence for some time, and then she stood and placed a comforting hand on my shoulder.  I realized that not only do I understand her pain, but now there was someone who understood mine.  It felt good, and I didn't want her to take that hand away.\n\nBut she did.  She dropped it slowly to her side and left the tent without another word.  I looked down at the chessboard.  Only then did I notice Valita had me in checkmate.",

It's in some kind of odd code, but codes are like puzzles to me - and I'm the best at solving puzzles in all of AvLee!\"\n\nThen Aspen turned to the Harpy and slapped her hard across the face.\n\n\"Tell him what you told me,\" the Elf demanded.\n\nThe Harpy said, \"I pick up the note is all I do!  I fly in at night, pick up the note from an arrow in the top of the tree, and take it back to my master.  That's all I do - I carry things!\"\n\n\"And the arrow - what did it look like?\"\n\n\"An Elven arrow, with black and green feathers,\" the Harpy said immediately.\n\nI clenched my fists because I immediately knew what those colors meant.  Those were the colors Valita used on her arrows.\n\nI glared at the scouts and said, \"Take the Harpy to my tent.  I will interrogate her myself.\"\n\nThen to Aspen, I said, \"Break the code.

Only commanders are allowed their own colors.\"\n\nThen Kurbon realized what colors I was asking about.\n\n\"This is about Valita, isn't it?  What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\n\"Aspen thinks he's finally uncovered his spy,\" I said.  I left, knowing already that I had said too much.  If Valita was the spy, she would soon find out that Aspen was close to proving it.\n\nBut I didn't care.\n\nWhen I got back to my tent, however, I noticed the chessboard sitting on my strategy table.  I had scheduled a game with Aspen, but I didn't feel much like playing anymore.  Then I got to thinking about the strategies I had been using, about the one Valita has been teaching me, and even about some of the ones I've learned from Aspen.\n\nAnd then I realized that I hadn't been considering all the pieces in this spy game I have been dragged into.",

It's coded - unreadable - and according to Aspen very difficult to break.\"\n\n\"And the other paper?\" Valita asked.\n\n\"A translation, completed this morning by Aspen, although no one knows yet that he has broken the code.\"\n\nI stood up and approached Valita, handing her the notes.  She looked at them briefly, then back to me.\n\n\"Do you believe I am a spy?\" she asked softly.\n\nI could tell by her expression that she already knew suspicion had been cast her way.\n\nBut I leaned forward and placed my lips on hers, finding them thin but extremely soft and warm.  She didn't pull away as the part of me that didn't want to be hurt had hoped.  Instead, she kissed me back, and placed a hand on my hip.\n\nShe asked again, \"Do you think I am the spy?\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't kiss a spy,\" I said.  \"I think I've been watching the queen while my enemy sneaks his bishop in for checkmate.\"\n\n\"What?\" Valita asked, but I didn't want to explain right now.\n\nI kissed her again.",

He looked directly at Valita, who was standing next to me.  Many of the other soldiers were already gathering around us.\n\n\"You've translated it so quickly?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, I know the code by heart,\" Aspen said.  \"Mutare will have no more secrets!\"\n\n\"And who's the spy?\"\n\n\"It's...\"\n\nThe arrow nicked my shoulder on its way into Aspen's chest.  The Elf's face suddenly went as white as snow.  His knees buckled, but Valita caught him before he hit the ground.\n\nI turned, shouting orders for the assassin to be found.\n\nThen I looked back to Valita - there were tears on her cheeks.\n\n\"I can't believe it's really him,\" she said.  \"You were right.\"\n",

I wanted to tell her so many things, but they wouldn't pass through my lips.

You spend long enough in the hands of the enemy, and soon their side makes sense. You, too, would do anything to stop that kind of pain!\"\n\nI heard movement in the trees around me, but pretended not to notice it.  Instead, I brought one hand out and held it above my head.\n\n\"Speaking of Aspen, I have something for you,\" I said, and threw the small white statue up to Kurbon.\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\n\"The bishop - the advisor.  You took Aspen, but I promise that will be the only piece you ever take!\"\n\nKurbon chuckled, placing the piece in his belt.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Tarnum, but before the night is done I plan to take the king as well,\" he said, lowering his axe.\n\nThe shadows came alive as dozens of Minotaurs charged from the forest.\n\nI would've been a fool not to realize this was a trap.  I sprinted toward the boulder, raising a wooden whistle to my lips.  I blew as hard as I could even as I dove into a recess between the rock and the ground.  It provided me just enough cover.\n\nThe Minotaurs stopped in the middle of the clearing as they heard a hissing sound cutting the night air.  They looked up.  Something blocked out the stars in the sky, and then hundreds of arrows rained down on them.  My archers had fired from extreme range.  We'd spent the last two days practicing this maneuver, so it worked.\n\nNo one survived that first attack, except Kurbon, thanks to his thick armor.

We killed all of the second wave too, but at the cost of the last of our Dragons.

I can't face Vorr alone.  In fact, I'm not sure I have the power to defeat an Ancestor, especially a mad one like Vorr.\n\nIs it even possible to kill an Ancestor?",
    "map.hc6_main:0.event.2.description": "I woke this morning sick for the first time in centuries.  I rushed from my tent, dropped to my knees, and heaved for nearly an hour.  Even now, I can barely sit in the saddle.  Sweat rolls down my face as if the rain fell on me alone.  And I can feel the heat emanating from my skin.\n\nHow can this be?\n\nThen it occurred to me that perhaps I am somehow linked to the Ancestors.  Perhaps my immortality comes from them, as if I were part of them.  If so, then what would happen if Vorr managed to destroy the other Ancestors?  Would I die, or become mortal once again?\n\nEither way, it doesn't frighten me.  It is, however, what I have been fighting for all these years - to become normal once again.\n\nBut then I began to wonder what else would change by the death of the Ancestors.  They are our spiritual guides.  They are like a lighthouse for the Barbarian people.\n\nWithout them, would we smash against the rocks of fate?",

    "map.hc6_main:0.event.4.description": "I proposed a question to my wisest shaman, Wern, this morning.\n\n\"I sensed that Vorr fled to the northeast, but I no longer sense him.  Where could he have gone?\" I asked.\n\nThe wise man was silent for some time, and then said, \"What d'you bring me?\"\n\nIt was Wern's way.  In fact, the way of all shaman.  Since shaman didn't till their own fields, or raise their own sheep, they lived solely from the generosity of those who sought their wisdom.  I reached into a sack on my hip, removed a ceramic bottle, and pulled the stopper out with my teeth.\n\n\"Try it,\" I said.\n\nWern took a cautious sip.  His eyebrows perked up as he recognized the strong spirits within, then he took a long swallow.\n\n\"I'll think on this matter, Tarnum,\" Wern said.  He took another swallow.  Already, his cheeks became flushed.\n\n\"Come back another time,\" he said.",
    "map.hc6_main:0.event.5.description": "\"What d'you bring me?\" Wern, the shaman, asked when I entered the tent.\n\n\"I already brought you something.  A bottle?  Three days ago?\"\n\nBut there was no recognition in the shaman's expression.  Sighing, I left briefly and returned with a keg of ale from my own tent.\n\n\"Oh, good!  Now, return in a few days and let me meditate on...\"\n\nWern never finished his sentence because my hand closed around his scrawny throat.\n\n\"No, you'll answer me now, old man!\" I said.\n\nWhen I let go, Wern was more cooperative.  Wern's been known to keep people waiting for an answer for months.  If I hadn't shown the shaman I was serious, I would never learn anything.\n\n\"Ah, yes, you wanted to know where the Mad Ancestor could've gone.  I tried to talk to the spirits, but they are quiet.  Strange.  It worries me!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that already, but where could Vorr have gone?\"\n\n\"Without the guidance of the Ancestors, I can not say,\" Wern said.\n\nIn truth, none of us are whole without the Ancestors.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, standing.  Before I left, I added, \"Keep trying, will you?\"\n\nQuietly, Wern said, \"Of course.\" ",

While they watched from the bushes, I approached the Demons alone.  I faced Imps, and Gogs, and a single Demon alone.  If I hadn't caught them by surprise, I would've been killed.  Instead, I swept through them like an angry storm.\n\nFirst, I took out the Gogs, then the Demon leader.  Most of the Imps ran.  Unfortunately, they ran directly into my men, who joined the fray to finish the last of the creatures.\n\nPicking up one of the Imps, I said, \"This is what you've been afraid of!

I would be surprised if it did.\n",
    "map.hc6_main:1.event.4.description": "I was summoned into the healer's tent this morning where I found the captured Familiar bandaged, but awake.  It was missing one of its large ears and both wings.  According to the healer, one of its arms was broken as well.  It was lucky to be alive, and for a moment I grew furious at the thought that some of my men might've caused such wounds.\n\n\"Do you have a name?\" I asked it.\n\n\"Yes.  Sure.  Certainly,\" it said.  Its eyes flashed quickly from side-to-side as if it were searching for an enemy.\n\nI waited a moment, then said, \"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"Skizzik's me name.\"\n\n\"I'm Tarnum.  I'm the leader of these people,\" I announced.\n\n\"Yes, yes.  Me know.  We all know, you Tarnum the Immortal Hero.\"\n\nSkizzik's words startled me.  How could he know I was the Immortal Hero?  He couldn't, unless Vorr had told him.\n\n\"So, you do work with Vorr?\"\n\n\"Me?  No, no.  Me dead, long gone for good, a bucket-kicker, six-feet-under, a goner for sure!  Get it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand, but your kind works for Vorr?\"\n\nSkizzik nodded reluctantly.\n\n\"Me die now,\" the Familiar moaned, closing his eyes.\n\nOf course, Skizzik didn't die, but he did go to sleep, so I left him alone for now.",
    "map.hc6_main:1.event.5.description": "This time, I summoned the Familiar to my tent once it had an opportunity to heal more.  Two guards pushed it inside and waited, but I dismissed them.  The day I can't handle a single, half-crippled Familiar is the day I crawl into a hole and hide forever.\n\n\"Hungry, Skizzik?\" I asked, gesturing to the bread lying on a small table.\n\nWithout so much as a thank you, the Familiar snatched up the entire loaf and started shoving it in his mouth.\n\n\"You eat well for a corpse,\" I said.\n\n\"Me a bucket-kicker, that's right!\" Skizzik said, spitting crumbs everywhere.\n\n\"You realize, just because you say you're dead doesn't make it true?\"\n\n\"Of course!  But you don't know Skizzik's problem.  You don't know, he got himself many people mad at him.  All because I left the stupid door open!  Silly to me, it is!\"\n\n\"What door?\"\n\n\"To the cell where the big guy keeps the shiny people,\" said the Familiar.  It took me a second to realize he was talking about Vorr and the Ancestors.\n\nQuickly, I grabbed Skizzik's good arm and said, \"Now listen carefully!  You know where the Ancestors are?\"\n\n\"Me know.\"\n\nAgain, I waited, but when I was certain Skizzik wouldn't respond I opened my mouth to speak.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Skizzik interrupted.  \"You want to know, don't you!\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n",
    "map.hc6_main:1.event.6.description": "I'm not sure what to make of Skizzik's account.  The Familiar claims Vorr took the Ancestors to the Fiery Moon, imprisoning them in a magical prison while he left to handle something else.  That's when Skizzik first saw the Ancestors.  He was one of the prison workers - the water bearer.  Shortly after the arrival of the Ancestors, however, he left the door open briefly.  The Ancestors didn't escape, but the Demons and things were really upset with him.  Something about them being able to call for help, but Skizzik swears the Fiery Moon has nothing but Demons and things on it.\n\nPerhaps the call that urged me to save the World Tree had been the cry the Demons were talking about.  If that was so, then I finally understand why the Ancestors have been so quiet.\n\nSo, when the Demons found out about Skizzik's mistake, they tried to kill him, but the Familiar managed to escape.  He fled the Fiery Moon through something called the Sparkling Bridge, and despite his many injuries managed to make it this far.  A brave creature, I have to admit.",

I don't think he's a spy, but I'm not stupid, Grumba!

With one squeeze, he could crush the life from Skizzik.\n\n\"No!  Put him down, Grumba!\" I ordered.\n\nThe Ogre reluctantly set Skizzik on the ground.\n\n\"What were you so excited about?\" I asked the Familiar.\n\nSkizzik pointed off toward a distant hill and said, \"Me see some Demons bury some Gold they stole.  Me see them over in them hills, back before me become a bucket-kicker - I hides in a cold bush and sees them!\"\n\n\"Gold?\" I said doubtfully.  Could this be a trap?

He hit an Orc, one of my own troops, in the knee before he met the enemy.\n\nUnfortunately, the Fire Elementals weren't impressed.  One burned the weapon from Skizzik's hands and would've turned the Familiar into a blackened spot on the ground if I hadn't arrived in time.\n\nAfterward, I immediately summoned the armorer and ordered him to forge an axe that wouldn't break so easily.

Grumba was easily five times his size.\n\n\"You take that back, ugly!  What?  You think your home is any better - nothin' but dirt and rocks and cow dung!  Call that a home?\"\n\nI stepped forward, afraid Grumba might squash Skizzik, but the Ogre just seemed startled and amused that the little guy would actually dare stand up to him.\n\n\"Fair enough,\" Grumba said.  \"But tell us, guide, where would Vorr keep the Ancestors?\"\n\nSkizzik took a few deep breaths to calm down, then pounced back up on the rock again.

Indeed, it was an old burial spot filled with half a dozen stone tables supporting the skeletal remains of what appeared to be warriors.\n\n\"Not like Demons to bury their dead like this,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, no they not Demons!  Those the ones who lived here before,\" Skizzik said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Before we Demons got here, there were others,\" Skizzik said.  He seemed to want to leave, as if he were afraid of ghosts or something.\n\n\"What happened to the others?\" I asked.\n\n\"They deep under - bucket-kickers like these guys.  We kill them all!  Well, not me.  That before Skizzik's time.  Me, all I see is the black and hot land like this - no green trees left for me to see.\"\n\nI looked sadly at these dead warriors who probably died fighting the Demons.  What had they been like?  Did they know they were destined to lose and still fought?  I clenched my fists in anger.  Such brave souls shouldn't end up forgotten in a hole in a dead world!\n\nThese Demons believed in nothing but destruction.  Honor meant nothing to them.  Wherever they went, I imagined Skizzik's kind turning every world into a copy of this Fiery Moon.\n\nAnd my world was certainly next.  Vorr's appetite for destruction was incredible - perhaps greater even than a Demon's - and now he has attracted these Demons to my world.\n\nI raised my sword above these forgotten warriors and swore, \"As long as blood pumps through my body, I swear my world will not become like this one!\"",

They had written them on the back of sheets of bark stripped carefully from the stubby swamp trees.  It took hours to read through them all.  There was a law for everything!\n\nThey began, as I suggested, with a law against slavery and from there moved through murder, theft, and other crimes.  Then they made laws for governing their work habits, eating habits, and even how much sleep is too much.\n\nI asked for it.  Now, what was I going to do with this monstrosity?",

Did he think the laws would enforce themselves?\n\n\"How else are you going to follow them?\"\n\nBrellick lowered his head, overwhelmed.\n\n\"But I have an idea,\" I said.  \"Maybe you could combine some of the laws.  For instance, laws 243 through 478 are all about stealing.  Don't steal another's food and things like that.  They are essentially the same thing, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Sounds easier, that's for sure.  I'll do it!\" Brellick said.\n\nIt took four Gnolls to help Brellick carry the laws from my tent.",

From her expression, I could tell she already knew the answer.\n\n\"There have been some problems.  Why?\"\n\n\"I've come to help before things get out of hand.  You may be good at directing these creatures in battle, but you don't know much about them, do you?  Never give a Gnoll male a job that requires organization!  They'll fail.

The Lizardman swiped at the Gnoll and missed, but scratched shallow furrows across MY face.  The wounds burned, igniting my fury.\n\nI released the Gnoll and punched the Lizardman so hard he flew ten feet into the mud.  Just to be fair, I turned on the startled Gnoll and pounded him in the stomach, doubling him over.\n\n\"Bind their hands and feet and throw them in a cage together!  They can work out their differences there,\" I said.\n\nWhen no one moved to follow my orders, I said, \"Can't you hear?\"\n\n\"Uh, yes, sir,\" said a meek-looking Gnoll, \"but they're not slaves anymore.

The Gnolls walked with their heads held low, dragging their flails behind them in the mud.\n\n\"What happened, friend?\" I asked.\n\nBrellick shook his head and muttered, \"They're all dead!  Women.  Pups.  All of them!\"\n\n\"Paglon got to them?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.  Not even Paglon has been this brutal,\" Brellick said.

A few of the trees around the entrance to the cave had been burned black and lifeless by a recent fire.\n\n\"Half of you form up on the left, the others on the right,\" I ordered, drawing my sword.  \"I'm going in.\"\n\nI slipped into the cave on my hands and knees.  The scent of charred vegetation was replaced by the pungent odour of burned flesh.  I knew what I would find even before I saw the bodies, but I still couldn't stop.  I crawled to the back of the cave, trying not to breathe the disgusting air.\n\nAnd I found the deserters.  That is, what was left of them.  Their killers had ambushed them while they slept, removing their heads, stealing their supplies, and for some reason they set the cave on fire.\n\nThese were the type of people we were dealing with.  Murderers!\n\nIf only I had the time to turn my army against Mad King Gryphonheart.  The man was a blight on this land.  But I wasn't here for vengeance.  I was here to save a people from destruction.",

What would they do when my time with them was over?  Who would lead them?\n\nThat was the point, wasn't it?  As the Barbarian Tyrant, I led my people astray.  I taught them how to be brutal, merciless, uncaring.  It would take much for them to unlearn those lessons.  It would take a leader, a teacher, someone to guide them.  Finally, I knew how to correct the errors I made!\n\nAnd I knew the same would be true for the Mudlanders.  Just as my people, after I freed them from slavery, needed a good leader to guide them.  I also knew that I couldn't be that leader.  One day, the Ancestors would call me away.  They needed one of their own.\n\nBut who?",
    "map.hc7_main:2.event.5.description": "Who can lead the Mudlanders when I am gone?\n\nThat is the question that was on my every thought until I saw the young warrior, Droglo.  He was what they call a 'swamp-boy', a human raised in the swamp among the creatures.  Although not a slave himself, he had spent much of his life battling the Erathians.\n\nBut it wasn't his resourcefulness, or his battle skills, or even his charisma that convinced me he would be an excellent leader of the Mudlanders.  It was his compassion.\n\nSome Gnolls brought Droglo to my camp as a prisoner.  The Gnolls had been responsible for some Erathian captives when the boy released them, so they brought me Droglo instead.\n\nWhen I asked the boy why he let the prisoners free, Droglo said, \"Because they were innocent.  I heard the Gnolls accusing them of slaughtering some children, but I know that is not true.  I already killed the thugs responsible for that crime!\"\n\n\"Don't you think they are still guilty of other crimes?  For instance, slavery?\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I don't think they chose to lock our people up.  There've been Mudlander slaves here before they were born.  The way I see it, it's that Mad King's fault and the fault of his father and his father before that.  Those soldiers held slaves, same as we Mudlanders work for our masters.  It's how things are!\"\n\nThat's when I knew Droglo would be the perfect leader for these Mudlanders.  But first, I had to turn him into something more than a simple 'swamp-boy'.",

Perhaps with Paglon out of the way, some of the murders will stop.  Then who will pay the bounty?",
    "map.hc7_main:2.event.7.description": "Brellick and a few other Gnolls approached me early this morning, but it wasn't Brellick who spoke to me.  One of the other soldiers stepped nervously forward.\n\n\"Sir, I have bad news,\" the Gnoll stammered.\n\nI looked at Brellick and the others.  They were afraid of me, or perhaps it was my response they feared?  When did I get a reputation for cruelty?  Then I recalled that all these Gnolls had been slaves just a few short months ago.  Whenever they had to report bad news to their masters, they were probably whipped for it.  No wonder they expect me to respond similarly.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked.\n\n\"We,\" the Gnoll began, glancing at Brellick and the others for support, \"were checking the supplies before we began the march today.  Practically an entire wagon is missing!\"\n\n\"Really?  Are you sure?\" I asked calmly.  Wagons didn't just disappear, but I didn't want to give my own troops reason to fear me, so I restrained my shock.\n\n\"We think deserters stole the resources,\" Brellick said.\n\n\"Deserters?  How many?\"\n\n\"Nearly a dozen.  I'm sad to say they are Gnolls, sir.\"\n\nWell, the desertions had begun.  I'm not surprised, considering the odds against us.  The true problem is how to deal with it.  Normally, swift and firm punishment would scare the rest of the soldiers straight, but if I responded with brutality these Gnolls would simply see me as another slavemaster.\n\n\"Send a search party after the deserters, but don't go out of your way.  I can't force them to fight, nor do I want to.\"\n\nBrellick nodded and turned to leave.\n\n\"One more thing,\" I said.  \"Order the search party to capture the deserters.  Don't kill them!

If not the Erathians, then someone else will walk in and enslave us.\"\n\n\"A wise choice, but I seem to recall from the ancient stories a great and horrible leader of the Barbarians who made another choice,\" Adamina said.\n\nSo, she suspected I wasn't who I said I was, but how much did she know?\n\n\"He was wrong!

If the enemy attacked, I should have plenty of time to escape.\n\n\"Are you the leader of the rebels?\" the well-dressed man asked.

I apologize.\"\n\n\"Accepted, and I am Tarnum.  I lead for now,\" I said.  I didn't want this man to know that if I were to die, I suspected the rebellion would collapse and the Mudlanders would return to slavery.\n\nThe noble explained that not all of Erathia supports King Gryphonheart.  In fact, if he weren't so powerful there would've been a coup long ago.\n\n\"So, you don't have the courage to rid yourself of a King you don't even like!

I have it on good authority that he fully expects his son to fail.\"\n\nI felt the bile rise in my throat.  Gryphonheart became more disgusting with each passing day.\n\n\"Why would he kill his own son?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because Niven is soft on slaves.  Because he knows that Niven has the support of all the nobility and he could be used to raise Erathia against him,\" the noble said.\n\nI've seen Niven's compassion toward slaves first hand.  He's the first Erathian I've faced that hasn't slaughtered every escaped slave he can find.  He's even removed the bounty on slave heads, replacing it with a single bounty for me instead.  A smart move, trying to cut the head off the snake.\n\n\"I still don't know what this has to do with me,\" I said.  What else was this noble willing to reveal?\n\n\"Please don't kill the Prince!  If you can't turn away, at least spare his life if you should ever defeat him.  We would pay a healthy ransom for the Prince, if alive.\"\n\nThis was interesting, but I couldn't make any promises.\n\n\"I have no interest in acting as Mad King Gryphonheart's assassin,\" I said, \"but if the good Prince gets in my way neither will I risk the life of even one of my people to keep him alive.

We moved slowly, covered in mud from head to toe.  We each wore only a loincloth, carried only a dagger.  Droglo's small, wiry frame was made for this kind of lurking, and although I was considered large by any standards, I had more years experience than I dared count.\n\nWe only had to kill two guards on our way to the Prince's tent, where I clubbed the young royal unconscious and threw him over my shoulder.

I just hoped he had the courage to change as well.\n\n\"I'm not going to kill you, if that's what you mean.  I want you alive to see what Erathia has become under the leadership of your father,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm not interested in your lies!\"\n\n\"All I ask is that you look and listen, Prince, not believe.

Now, I wouldn't be so naive as to ask you to set them free, but Rambert threatens to kill them all until I free you.  If you are an honourable man, Prince Niven, then order him not to touch these people.  Since I have given my word that I will release you one way or the other, you have nothing to fear.  Just don't let your man kill my people,\" I said.\n\nAfter several quiet moments, Niven nodded and said, \"Give me pen and paper.  I will make certain that they are treated civilly.\"",

Some won't even survive the night,\" I said.\n\n\"Convenient,\" Niven said after some time.\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"I have never seen slaves in this condition before.  I have never even seen one whipped; yet here you are marching a horde of them before my eyes.  A bit convenient, don't you think?\"\n\n\"You think this is fake?\" I asked.  Was he that blind?\n\nNiven shrugged.\n\n\"I'll bet the only slaves you've seen have been house slaves, slaves who have soft hands because they never do any hard labour,\" I said.

Then he saw the pits.  Dozens of slaves were crammed so tightly in the holes they could barely move.\n\nIn the centre of the camp, at least of score of corpses hung from bare, dead trees as a warning to others who tried to escape.  Somehow, a Lizardman child managed to get away from her pen and clutched at the dangling heels of a Lizardman male who had been hung by the neck.\n\n\"That is a slave's life,\" I said.\n\nNiven's breath caught in his constricted throat.  Now, he was crying real tears, not just responding to the smell.\n\n\"The only thing we have to be thankful for is a short life,\" Droglo added bitterly.\n\n\"I didn't know,\" Niven said.  \"They were just beasts.

We did it for us, for the Mudlanders!  His own people say they would follow him if he just raised his sword against his father.

Even though we're outnumbered, I didn't expect an attack so soon.\n\nGryphonheart's influence has been felt even though he does not lead these vanguard troops.  He must've ordered his troops to attack my camp at night.  Only a madman would give such an order when facing creatures native to the swamps.\n\nA dozen of my new recruits were killed in the initial attack, but my troops responded quickly and they're eyes were much more suited to the dark than those of the Erathians.\n\nSoon we routed the enemy, killing half their number in the process.

I almost laughed when I saw their similarity to the unwritten Barbarian laws.  Many of their ideals are based on the old beliefs of my own culture before I tainted it.\n\nOne difference is their strict laws against slavery.  As a race that has had a taste of slavery, they have reacted almost fanatically against it.  Besides murder, holding another person as a slave is the only crime punishable by death.\n\n\"They look good,\" I said.  \"So, what do you think of Droglo?\"\n\nAdamina scratched her knobby head.\n\n\"Young.\"\n\n\"Yes, but wise beyond his years!  I've been thinking about naming him as my second.  Of course, I'd like to get the approval of the wisewomen first.\"\n\nAdamina looked at me for a long time before she answered.\n\n\"I will ask them.  We will let you know,\" she said.  She stood as if she were about to leave, but stopped at the exit to my tent.\n\n\"There are forces at work around you, Tarnum.  For the first time, I do not doubt that you will free our people.

Until now, I had never shown anything but complete confidence in our inevitable victory.\n\n\"We need help, Droglo, but I don't have the time to wait for the wisewomen to agree with me.  In fact, I'm certain they won't,\" I continued.\n\n\"What do you have in mind?\"\n\n\"Barbarians.\"\n\n\"But they're murderers!\" Droglo protested.\n\n\"Yes, and they know how to defeat the Erathians!  The Mudlanders are brave fighters, but the only reason we haven't lost is the Erathians keep fighting us on our own terms - in the swamp.  Even we can't beat the numbers Gryphonheart is going to throw at us!\"\n\nAs much as he tried, Droglo couldn't defeat my logic.

It was too painful for him to smile, and he talked without moving his mouth.\n\n\"A duel,\" he said.  \"They made me battle one of their best warriors - an Orc.\"\n\n\"Even though you told them you were acting as my voice?\" I said, shocked.\n\nDroglo nodded.\n\nAccording to custom, Droglo should have been under my protection.  If they had wanted a test of our strength, they should've sent their best warrior to face me in one-on-one battle, not force 'my voice' to fight.  Apparently, I didn't know my people as well as I thought.\n\n\"How did they respond to my offer?\" I asked.\n\n\"They agreed to help, but at double the price you offered.  And they said if we didn't pay, perhaps the Erathians would,\" Droglo said.\n\nI clenched my fists but tried not to reveal the anger boiling within.  My people owed the Mudlanders for their help in freeing them long ago, and this was how they repaid their debt!

If they were going to have their own nation, they needed a name as well.\n\nAt first, this honour fell to me, their leader, but I refused.\n\n\"Something as important as this should be the responsibility of the community, not one man,\" I had said.  Not to mention, I didn't feel right naming the people I once subjugated.\n\nAdamina and the wisewomen agreed and set about the task of naming a nation.  Of course, I wasn't going to hold my breath.

I'm sure you will notice the strategic benefit of this location, plus it will place my father's troops in a location from which he cannot flee.

A few smudges of dirt and the angry pink scar on his jaw marred his otherwise perfect face.  Droglo couldn't grow a moustache if he spent the next three years trying.  He would always look young when standing next to his friend.\n\n\"Well, I guess I should call you King now,\" I said, taking Niven's hand.\n\n\"It's only a title, Tarnum,\" Niven said.\n\nAs much as we wanted to continue joking to keep this pleasant moment alive, we had serious work ahead of us.\n\n\"Your father's armies are in the south.

I tried to reason with them, but they would not believe we were allies until Droglo convinced them to stop their attacks,\" Niven stated.\n\n\"So, we're both having trouble.  The only good news is your father has lost his support from home.  He's alone, except for the thieves and mercenaries he's been hiring.

That was the only way to break an ambush - charge directly at them.\n\nAfter the initial shock, I snapped off the shaft of the arrow in case the head was barbed and chased after Droglo to make sure the boy didn't get into trouble.  I came to the spot where most of the Rogues had been killed, but there was no sign of Droglo.\n\nTo one of the Gnolls, I demanded, \"Where is Droglo?\"\n\n\"He went running off after one of them who escaped.

Abandoned for who knows how many years, nature had reclaimed the land.  But what I thought had been a mound turned out to be the cracked head and torso of a giant statue of a man.  It had fallen on its side.  Vines hugged it tightly like a dying child.\n\nDroglo turned slowly to stare at me.\n\n\"It's you!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.",

Did he know that, in his arrogance, the Barbarian Tyrant had statues of himself erected all over the continent?  Did he know that I had been the Barbarian Tyrant?\n\n\"Explain?\" Droglo asked.  \"Can you explain why you have the face of the Tyrant?  I don't see how.  You can't be the Tyrant - he's been dead for a very long time.  So, it must be coincidence, right?\"\n\nI could tell by the tears in Droglo's eyes that he didn't believe his own words.\n\n\"That's right,\" I said.  If Droglo didn't want to talk about it, I had to accept that, but he deserved some kind of explanation.\n\nI asked, \"If a man - a King - made many terrible mistakes, do you think he should have the chance to redeem himself?\"\n\n\"Depends on the man, I think,\" Droglo said.  \"Take Mad King Gryphonheart, for instance.  His crimes are too great!  He deserves only to rot in a pit for all eternity!\"\n\nIf only the boy knew Gryphonheart's crimes were nothing compared to my own.\n\n\"Well, if that man got the chance to make things right, he would probably look for someone who was nothing like he used to be - someone fair and good - to take over when he was gone.\"\n\nI left the tent knowing that this revolt would be over soon and I would never see Droglo again.  But I smiled.  Erathia was in good hands with Niven as their King, and Droglo would protect the people of Tatalia for as long as he lived.\n\nAnd one day soon that statue of the Barbarian Tyrant would vanish into the swamp forever.

It's no surprised the little creatures have learned to move around so quickly.  I admit, over the years, I have probably killed hundreds of Troglodytes, but now that I lead them I only want to protect them from their own allies.\n\nWhen a pair of Harpies started harassing a Troglodyte carrying some food to its friends, I jumped in and grabbed the winged women by their scrawny throats.  I knew I couldn't show any weakness around here or someone would try to kill me and take over my leadership.  Nor could I show compassion for another.\n\nSo, I kicked the Troglodyte to the ground and threw the Harpies up against the nearest tunnel wall.\n\n\"Did I say you could fight amongst each other?

By the time I came to my knees, I realized there was an arrow through my body.  An Elf ambush?\n\nNo.  I looked closer at the barbed arrowhead protruding from my skin and realized no Elf forged it.\n\nTurning slowly, I found a Medusa slithering slowly toward me with another arrow notched in her bow.  She smiled wickedly, hissed.  It was a power play.  In typical Nighon fashion, the Medusa was testing my strength as the leader and when I failed she would replace me.\n\n\"You are Overlord no longer,\" the Medusa said.  \"I rule now!\"\n\nI tried to lift my mace to defend myself, but my arms were going numb.  I should've known the Medusa would lace her arrows with poison.  Even though I couldn't truly die, in the eyes of my troops I would be dead, and it was too late for me to raise another army.\n\nThen a blast of magic struck the Medusa's bow, snapping it in half.

Creatures such as these Beholders didn't save me from the Medusa because they thought I was a good leader.  Nor were they motivated by compassion or loyalty.  No, they were making a different kind of power play, and they expected me to repay them at some point.\n\n\"You're walking again - good,\" said one of the Beholders.\n\n\"I want to thank you all for helping me,\" I said.

Another three went down before they could reach their weapons.  The rest put up a good fight, placing two arrows in Zarm's eye before we brought them down as well.\n\nWalking among the dead, I made sure the Beholders saw me smiling with satisfaction although on the inside I took no pleasure in killing my own troops.

Let us interrogate him.\"\n\n\"No, I will talk to him,\" I said.\n\nRemembering that I am supposed to be insane, I looked to my right into thin air and said, \"I told them, mother!  I'll talk to the savage...yes, alone!\"\n\nTurning back to the Beholders, I said, \"Take the Barbarian to my tent.  I will talk to him alone.\"\n\nLater, the Barbarian was escorted before me.  He appeared proud and strong, ready to die.\n\n\"Good day,\" I said.\n\n\"You lead this slime?\"\n\n\"Yes, and what are you savages doing so far from home?\" I asked.\n\n\"I represent my leader, Kija, third wife of King Kilgor of the Krewlod!\" the Barbarian said.\n\n\"What does she have to say?\"\n\n\"Only this, Nighon scum!  She has come to this land seeking the Sword of Frost.  She does not know why you have come here, but she warns you that if you get in her way she will string you up by your ankles.  Do you understand?\"\n\nSo, I was dealing with the third wife of Kilgor himself.  I'm sure she wasn't looking for the Sword of Frost for herself, but for her husband.  Again I had that sinking feeling in my stomach.  This was exactly what the Ancestors were talking about.  More than ever, I had to convince Gelu to stop looking for the Sword of Frost.  Imagine what a madman like Kilgor could do if it fell in his hands.\n\n\"Do you understand?\" the Barbarian messenger spat.\n\nJust then, I saw a shadow drift across my tent - the familiar shape of one of my Beholder advisors.  If I let this Barbarian talk to me in that way, the Beholders would sense a weakness.  As much as I disliked it, I still needed them and my troops.\n\nSo, I cleared the distance to the messenger in a single jump and broke his nose.  While he was stunned, I took away the Barbarian's weapon and broke his arm with the blunt end of the axe.  Then I threw the Barbarian outside the tent where everyone could see.\n\n\"Go tell that woman that I do what I wish!  I'm not like Kilgor, cowering behind his females when something has to be done.

Why else would I stay and fight when I could flee and continue my pursuit of Gelu?\n\nNone of that matters.  Ufretin committed himself to this battle.  He knows that I will come after him sooner or later, which only means that he will be well prepared for my arrival.",
    "map.hc8_main:4.event.5.description": "Neez and Kilkik brought a dozen Troglodytes before me today, accusing them of losing the 2100 Gold they were transporting from one of my mines.\n\n\"I need all the Gold I can get!  How can you lose that much?\" I shouted.\n\nThe Troglodytes couldn't answer, choosing instead to cower and plead for their lives.  Neez, however, offered a possible scenario.\n\n\"They probably went to sleep and didn't post a guard.  Elves aren't above stealing when they need to.  Who else would take the Gold but leave these scum alive and well?\" Neez said.\n\n\"Sleeping!\"  I slapped the nearest Troglodyte hard enough to knock it unconscious.\n\nWhat was I going to do?  Showing mercy with these workers would make me appear weak.  Mistakes of this calibre were always punished in the same way.  Death.\n\nBut I couldn't execute them.\n\n\"You are the luckiest scum I have ever met!\" I said.\n\nNeez squinted at me curiously, and said, \"Lucky?  How are they lucky?\"\n\nI threw my weapon on the ground.\n\n\"Because I can't kill them today, and I really want to!  But I had a dream last night that told me I would die in battle with an Elven arrow through my neck if I killed any of my own troops today,\" I explained.\n\nI glared at the Neez and then at the Troglodytes with my eyes as wide as possible, hoping that they would realize this was just one of my moments of insanity.  My Beholder advisor, however, just scowled at me.  He was not pleased.  I wasn't going to get away with this one.\n\n\"But I have another idea,\" I said quickly.  I marched in front of the hapless Troglodytes and to them I said, \"I have a mission for you, men!  I want you to march on the Rampart of my enemy, the Dwarf Ufretin.  You will bring him back to me, alive.  Just to be sure you follow your orders, my advisor, Neez will accompany you.\"\n\nThe Troglodytes, who a moment ago thought they were safe, now appeared crestfallen.  How could such a small number conquer so many Elves and Dwarves?  It was a suicide mission.\n\n\"But Overlord...\" Neez said.  He realized that his own life would be in danger as well.\n\n\"Oh, don't you worry, Neez!  I'm not asking you to attack the Rampart - just to watch over these Troglodytes until they have captured the Dwarf or died trying.  Whichever comes first?  Do as I order, because tomorrow I am no longer restricted from slaying my own troops!\"\n\nAt least this way, the poor Troglodytes had a chance - even if it was a miniscule one.  Unfortunately, something had to be done about Neez.  I could tell by his look that I had just earned another enemy.",

I knew the Beholder wouldn't be foolish enough to attack me one-on-one, but there was something in his dark eye that told me Kilkik no longer felt any loyalty toward me.\n\nSo, I stood and called, \"I want to introduce you to someone, Kilkik.  Trongar!\"\n\nA secret slit in the back of my tent parted and a massive, black Minotaur King stepped inside.  He had to bow his great head to avoid tearing the ceiling of my tent.\n\n\"Kilkik, meet Trongar, my new bodyguard.  I hired him last night,\" I said.\n\nKilkik studied the Minotaur for a long time, realizing now that I was twice as powerful as before.\n\n\"So, why have you come here, Kilkik?\" I asked.\n\n\"To report some bad news,\" Kilkik said.  \"The Troglodytes you sent to capture Ufretin were killed before they even reached his Rampart.  An Elven ambush!  Unfortunately, our loyal companion, Neez, was slaughtered as well!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!  I really am,\" I said.  \"You may go now.  Leave me to my grief.\"\n\nOnce I was alone with Trongar, I tossed him a heavy bag of Gold.\n\n\"That one's dangerous,\" Trongar said.\n\n\"Yes, I know, but he just lost his strongest ally.  It will take him a while to regain his power,\" I said.\n\nJust before Trongar left the tent, I said, \"Good work, by the way.  I assume the Medusas used Elven arrows to make it look like our enemy did it.\"\n\n\"Yes.  They were all too willing to get back on your good graces - and to get at least partial revenge for the deaths of their sisters,\" Trongar said.\n\nI smiled, but inside my guts were twisting with shame.

Or are you a coward?\" Ufretin responded.\n\nI had hoped to wear my helm at all times.  If I showed him my face, I took a chance of Ufretin recognizing me as the same Tarnum who lived and fought alongside the Elves of AvLee for all those years.  But I figured I owed Ufretin that much at least.\n\nI took off my helm, and despite the black designs painted on my face he recognized me.\n\n\"Tarnum Dragonfriend!\"\n\nThat was my Elven name.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It can't be!\" Ufretin said.\n\n\"It can, and it is,\" I said.  I looked around to make sure no one was within earshot.  I shudder to think what would happen if my Nighon troops learned that I used to fight for AvLee.\n\n\"I am Tarnum, so believe me when I say I don't wish to harm you.  I beg for your help, Ufretin.  Maybe I can avoid more deaths!\"\n\nUfretin was quiet for a long time.  I could tell by his expression that I was one of the last people he would've ever expected behind that helm.

I'm afraid if I don't learn the location of the Sword of Frost soon, I will never have the chance to stop Gelu.\n\n\"No torture!\" I said.  \"At least, not yet.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Kilkik said.\n\nHe had a right to be confused.  I have allowed torture before, but only because I wasn't part of it.  I didn't know the people.  I didn't have to listen to their screams.  But with Ufretin, a bold hero who deserves better, I couldn't bring myself to allow it.\n\nAnd my reluctance was causing a stir among the troops.

He's being a fool looking for this Sword of Frost!\" I said.\n\n\"He only wants to destroy it - not use it!  Not like you!\"\n\n\"I don't want to use it!  I don't even want it to be found at all!\"\n\nBut Ufretin didn't believe me.  In his eyes, I was a traitor.  I was one of the Nighons now.  How could I convince him otherwise?

I'm not going to tell you anything.\"\n\n\"I came to explain myself - to really explain myself,\" I said.\n\nIt has come to this.  I could think of no other reason why Ufretin would ever speak to me, short of torture, and I wasn't going to resort to that.  Already, I feel I have allowed myself to be dragged too far down by my troops.\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" Ufretin asked.\n\nI looked around to make sure no one was watching.  Then slowly, I pulled my shirt apart to reveal my naked chest.\n\n\"I am immortal, Ufretin.  I am not just long-lived like the Elves and Dragons.  I am immortal - I can't die!\"\n\n\"You're a fool!\"\n\n\"I was a fool once, a cruel one, and I've been paying for my brutality ever since.  I will probably pay for it until the end of time.  That's why I am here! That's why I must stop Gelu!

How?\"\n\n\"Like I said, I am immortal.\"\n\n\"How?  Why?\" Ufretin asked.  I no longer saw hatred in this man's eyes, but fear.\n\nOver the next hour, I told him a shortened version of my story.  I tried to explain my actions by describing the cruelty of the Wizard-Kings who enslaved my people, but when I described the hundreds of villages I burned to the ground and the thousands of people I slaughtered my excuse seemed weak.  Finally, I told him how I died, and how the Ancestors refused to allow me to enter Paradise.\n\n\"I do what they ask - I am their servant until I can redeem myself.  But they have never asked me to fight against my friends before.  I couldn't convince anyone else to fight Gelu!\"\n\n\"I don't know, Tarnum,\" Ufretin said.  \"This is a lot to take in - a lot to believe at once.\"\n\n\"Search your heart, and ask yourself why I haven't allowed anyone to torture you.
